2. **PopulationDensity**: Numerical (people per square kilometer)
3. **VaccinationCoverage**: Numerical (percentage of the population that has received the polio vaccine)
4. **HistoricalOutbreakData**: Numerical (number of polio cases reported in the last 5 years)
5. **HealthcareAccessLevel**: Categorical (Low, Medium, High)
6. **EconomicStatus**: Categorical (Low-income, Lower-middle-income, Upper-middle-income, High-income)
7. **WaterSanitationFacilities**: Categorical (Poor, Moderate, Good)
