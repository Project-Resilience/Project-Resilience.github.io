# Combat Desertification Programs

<!-- Describe the project in one sentence, e.g. A project that... -->
We focus on developing a decision support system to predict and evaluate the effectiveness of various strategies to
combat desertification. This system aims to assist policymakers and land managers in making informed decisions on the
best approaches to prevent or reverse desertification in vulnerable areas.
