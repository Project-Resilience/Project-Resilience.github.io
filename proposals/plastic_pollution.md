# Plastic Pollution Reduction

<!-- Describe the project in one sentence, e.g. A project that... -->
For a focused scope on Marine Pollution Reduction Strategies, we'll concentrate on a single pollution type:
Plastic Pollution. This choice is due to the widespread recognition of plastic waste as a significant and growing threat
to marine environments worldwide.
